chear-kb:STD-Pilot-1,Pilot 1,Urine Biomarkers for Eosinophilic Esophagitis,Study pertaining to Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE); a rapidly emerging allergic disease affecting all ages; which presents with esophageal food impaction; dysphagia and esophageal stricturing. A non-invasive method to assess disease activity in patients with established EoE is needed and we believe that a urine or serum test for assessing disease activity in EoE patients will be useful clinically and also will help increase our understanding of the biology of this important condition.,50,180,University of Minnesota,Minneapolis; MN,Glenn R.
